# Profile: Liberty for All: Chris Ivey, Filmmaker

Filmmaker Chris Ivey didn’t expect things to be easy when he set out to make East of Liberty: A Story of Good Intentions, a multi-part documentary film about issues of race, class and gentrification resulting from the ongoing redevelopment of Pittsburgh’s East Liberty neighborhood. But after finishing and screening its first part, Ivey ran into an unusual problem: His target audience—the people most affected by, or frustrated with, the situation—wasn’t getting involved, or even attending the screenings.

“Of the 2,700 who came to the regular screenings, probably less than 500 were black—and that’s the target audience! So, if they’re not going to come out, I’m going to go to them.”

In the summer of 2008, Ivey organized a series of free, outdoor screenings, supported by a Grassroots Grant, in traditionally African-American neighborhoods of Pittsburgh such as Homewood and the Hill District.

Expanding the film’s audience wasn’t Ivey’s only motive. While making the film, “it was really a struggle, getting people to open up,” says Ivey. “Any kind of media, in their opinion, always makes you look bad.” The screenings provided Ivey with an opportunity to show those communities that he was telling the whole story, which he’ll continue to do as a filmmaker as long as he’s in Pittsburgh.

“There are some happy stories, some good things that happened, but of course some people make it, and some people don’t,” says Ivey. “A lot of people fall through the cracks, and we see some really sad stories, too.

“This is frank stuff, and I know it’s frustrating for some local media to cover these communities. But, for one thing, just because I’m black, it’s easier for me to get access to those communities—because I am them, so I have a real opportunity. It’s all about telling the truth, about getting past that Pittsburgh politeness, and getting people to open up.”
