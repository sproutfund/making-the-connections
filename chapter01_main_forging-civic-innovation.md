# Forging Civic Innovation

When Pittsburgh celebrated its 200th anniversary in 1958, the “Pittsburgh Renaissance” of Mayor David L. Lawrence was well underway. Using its bicentennial as a moment to chart a new course, the city looked to a future without the soot and smog that it was famous for—a chance, under the slogan of “Gateway to the Future,” to quite literally clear the air. At the time, the region’s leadership envisioned a future built as much around banking, education, and technology as the past was built around the steel mills along the rivers.

## Call and Response

So when it came time to celebrate the 250th anniversary in 2008, the Pittsburgh 250 Commission was faced with a challenge. With Pittsburgh’s “smoky old town” image finally on its way out, and the transition to a more diverse and global economy underway, how could Pittsburgh best capitalize on this moment? In a time when regions now rise and fall together as collections of cooperative and interdependent communities rather than isolated and stratified rivals, the Commission recognized that the best possible future for Southwestern Pennsylvania is one in which everyone—from the smallest boroughs of the most distant counties to the largest corporations in the tallest skyscrapers—has a stake in the place they call home.

Searching for inspiration, the Commission looked to Jamestown, Virginia, where the historic colonial town celebrated its 400th anniversary in 2007 by connecting small community events and projects to the larger-scale anniversary events. With this kind of collaborative spirit in mind, the Commission approached three leaders of dynamic, nonprofit organizations to adapt this model to suit the Pittsburgh region at this moment in time.

“The challenge was how to be truly inclusive,” says Aradhna Dhanda, president and CEO of Leadership Pittsburgh. “We wanted to learn from the people throughout this process, and then help them find ways they could celebrate the region’s anniversary.”

The trio of Dhanda, George Miles, Jr., president and CEO of WQED Multimedia, and Cathy Lewis Long, founding executive director of The Sprout Fund, became the co-chairs of the Community Connections Committee.

“This entire project had to come from the bottom up,” says George Miles, “it had to come from the people. There’s a lot of talk about ‘regionalism’—we really wanted that. We wanted folks in Greene County or in Greensburg to feel as much a part of this as those in the middle of Pittsburgh.”

The co-chairs, together with their committee of more than 40 leaders from Southwestern Pennsylvania, quickly realized that the answer was for Community Connections not to rebrand existing community projects under the banner of a larger initiative, but to cultivate and support new ideas created by and important to the region’s people. The program would draw resources from a wide selection of regional community foundations, private foundations, and corporate donors to create a pool of funds that could then be used to make small grants to organizations and individuals seeking to engage and empower communities during the commemorative celebration.

At first, it sounds like a straightforward idea: Give people money to invest in their own communities. But to ensure the money was awarded to the projects most valuable to participating communities, the Community Connections Committee flipped the standard model of philanthropy on its side.

It wasn’t just a new model that was required, but a whole new paradigm. While regional planning bodies have long developed high-level plans for the multi-county region, there was no system for organizing the hundreds of community organizations, service agencies, and engaged individuals at work in the region. Community Connections would give communities the power to decide for themselves where and how the region’s philanthropic dollars would be awarded.

The Committee realized that an initiative this large and bold couldn’t be operated by volunteers alone. This kind of work was cut out for an organization experienced in many of the facets that the initiative would require—and one already invested in creating the Community Connections concept.

Since its inception in 2001, The Sprout Fund had worked in the Pittsburgh area, funding and managing small projects through a variety of programs.

Sprout had made its name by catalyzing civic innovation, supporting unorthodox approaches to complex problems, and engaging communities to enact creative solutions to a variety of challenges. Programs like its signature Seed Award program, which makes small-scale funding awards to dozens of new projects each year, and its Public Art program, which leverages collaboration between local artists and community members to galvanize grassroots participation and decisionmaking, positioned Sprout as an organization with community decisionmaking experience that stood between the “treetops” and the grassroots.

And for Sprout, building the Community Connections process wouldn’t have to be done from scratch. As Board Chair Henry Simonds points out, it was more a matter of summing up Sprout’s proven strengths.

“We were able to incorporate elements from the Seed Award program, the Public Art program, and experience bringing large groups to the table with initiatives like Engage Pittsburgh and the Idea Round-Up,” says Simonds. “Taken in isolation, those programs are all great, but also disparate. For Community Connections, we put them all together to create something that’s sum was greater than the whole of its parts.”

## Fundraising Change

Community Connections set an ambitious fundraising goal of one million dollars to support projects in each of the 14 counties of Southwestern Pennsylvania. To plant new seeds, significant investment had to be made not just in Pittsburgh or Allegheny County, but in neighboring counties, towns and villages; communities that are of equal importance to the region’s history and future prosperity.

Fundraising was an integral part of the process of connecting communities—whether that was a small community foundation an hour’s drive south of Pittsburgh, or the corporate giving office of the region’s nationally known banks. As president of the Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation, the first private foundation to give to Community Connections, Pat Getty knows as well as anyone that raising money is about more than filling the pot. It’s the way that the philanthropic community builds its own connections.

“Funding is a part of the problem with a top-down structure,” says Getty. “We have to recognize that we need a more horizontal approach to every aspect of community life—an approach that engages a variety of people and organizations by inclusion. So it was important to get as many funders as possible for Community Connections.”

Sprout’s Cathy Lewis Long points out that this kind of fundraising outreach was part of Community Connections’ model from the very start.

“It was incumbent upon us to have a base of support that reflected the initiative’s inclusiveness,” says Lewis Long. “We knew that we wouldn’t be able to raise significant dollars in the outlying counties. But we also knew that we needed strong partners in each county, and community foundations are the ones working in those communities.”

It wasn’t until its sixth birthday, in 2007, that the Community Foundation of Greene County made its first regular, annual discretionary grants—the first regular assets, in other words, that the community foundation awarded other than pre-determined gifts. Rather than a project based in its county seat of Waynesburg, or one of the small but vibrant cultural organizations in Greensboro, that year the foundation made a $1,000 grant to Community Connections. And according to Executive Director Bettie Stammerjohn, it was a decision that was both easy to make, and important for the sparsely populated rural county.

“Until 1990, the population was small enough that we weren’t even counted in the Southwestern Pennsylvania regional census information,” says Stammerjohn. “Greene County was really overlooked for a long time. So we place a priority on helping to build the place of Greene County within the region. We saw the benefit of encouraging Sprout and Community Connections to be here—it benefits the county just to be a part of this regional initiative.”

Along with seven community foundations, Community Connections received funding from six private foundations such as Benedum and the Richard King Mellon Foundation, and eight corporate funders. According to Leslie Orbin, manager of communications and community relations for Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, a NiSource Company, the project was ideal for their giving plans, and those of other regional companies.

“We were interested in being involved in Pittsburgh 250, because of the company’s rich history in Southwestern Pennsylvania,” says Orbin. “For companies that work in all 14 counties in the region, a program that would impact small organizations in those counties was something we wanted to be a part of.”

Just as Community Connections would give the grassroots a stake in Pittsburgh 250 through small-scale Grassroots Projects, the initiative would make several larger funding awards to Regional Projects that affected many communities in multiple counties.

“Something Community Connections did,” says Benedum’s Getty, “was to demonstrate that there’s enthusiasm about working across the region towards change. That’s not something that happens without some kind of a nudge to broker connections throughout the region’s philanthropic community.”

## Idea Farming

Similar to its approach to fundraising, finding the projects and community leaders that would ultimately be funded by Community Connections called for a more considered approach than issuing a generic call for proposals. Through a series of idea generation, or “ideation,” sessions held in every county in the region, The Sprout Fund helped catalyze and foster ideas that would celebrate the “Pride and Progress” of this region—the theme of Community Connections—whether that was through an established organization, or just a few hard-working folks with a great idea.

To Valerie Huston, who attended the Armstrong County session, the issue concerning her seemed like a fairly simple fact of life: Food does not originate in the supermarket. Before it can be packaged and marketed, presented and paid for, food has to be grown by men and women working on farms like the one she lived on. But to so many American schoolchildren—even kids growing up in rural Western Pennsylvania—this basic fact is beyond their ken. “Ask an elementary school student where eggs come from, they say, ‘Foodland,’” says Tonya Wible, program manager of Pennsylvania’s Mobile Agriculture-Education (Ag/Ed) Science Lab. “Even in rural areas, they’re losing that connection with agriculture.”

One solution to this problem is a fleet of Pennsylvania Farm Bureau-operated mobile agricultural science labs that are able to pull up outside schools and give students hands-on learning experiences. But when Valerie Huston heard about the program in 2007, it was largely limited to the Eastern and Central parts of the state. Huston thought it was about time Western Pennsylvania had a dedicated lab of its own. She met with potential supporters such as the Armstrong County Commissioner’s office and Armstrong Educational Trust, who suggested she attend a workshop led by The Sprout Fund’s Community Connections Program Coordinator Dustin Stiver. And it was there that she discovered that community projects don’t just come from the big organizations—sometimes they, too, have to start ‘on the farm.’

“I gave a presentation on my project, and Dustin said, ‘I think I’ve heard this idea before.’ He put me in touch with Henry Karki, who he had met at the Mercer County ideation session and was working on the same project with the Beaver-Lawrence Farm Bureau, and we wrote the grant together.” After surviving multiple rounds of review, the Mobile Ag/Ed Science Lab project successfully navigated the decisionmaking process to receive a $50,000 Regional Grant. The new lab debuted in July, 2008, to a fully booked schedule visiting schools around the region.

“Many of the applications we received following the ideation sessions were from individuals that had never engaged in this type of activity before,” says Stiver. “Our goal was to reach into communities by designing a program that solicited ideas from both professional grantwriters and everyday citizens alike, and I think we accomplished that. Hundreds of people showed up, some with long-held ambitions, and others with freshly hatched ideas, but all demonstrating a passion for their community.”

At the sessions, held in each of the 14 counties of Southwestern Pennsylvania, a moderator led group discussions that encouraged participants to think of creative solutions to meet the needs of their communities. Afterwards, the most promising concepts were discussed further in breakout groups, to see what kinds of proposals for Community Connections grants might come forth.

According to Katrina Struloeff, marketing and development coordinator at the Union Project, a Pittsburgh-based nonprofit community center, and an ideation session moderator, the moderator’s job was part traffic cop—making sure everyone had their chance to speak—and part detective—investigating and probing ideas put forth by participants.

“We were empowering people to recognize that their ideas could be something,” says Struloeff, and to draw from the participants the true worth of their projects. “We were there to ask, ‘How would you explain the importance of your idea to someone who has never been to Cambria County before?’”

As attendees talked, several graphic facilitators—artists drafted from the Pittsburgh area—drew their impressions of each project, to create a visual complement to the verbal discussion. Pittsburgh illustrator Chris Schmidt served as graphic facilitator for several sessions. To him, the graphic facilitator’s job wasn’t just to draw peoples’ ideas, but to show the group what they had in common.

“People who develop collective ideas, they’re like the blind men trying to describe the elephant,” says Schmidt. “Each understands a part of it—but what does it all look like? When you finally detail that, visually, you generally find there’s consensus.”

Even in smaller areas, the widespread call for ideas brought new faces into the grantmaking process—people who might have never considered applying for a grant, or even beginning a project, in other circumstances.

When Dr. Stephen Catt, executive director of planning and external relations at Butler County Community College, co-hosted his county’s ideation session, he saw something come out of the meeting besides a handful of potential Community Connections project ideas.

“The money was the lure that brought everybody together,” says Catt, but perhaps not the most important part of the ideation sessions. “People gravitate towards their own networks, and once you’re in your own world, it’s hard to break out. The best part of these sessions were the new communications—the new networks that came out of them.”

## Granting Wishes

Community Connections was created and funded through regional collaboration. But none of those efforts would have been very meaningful without a similarly democratic process for deciding which projects to fund.

“It was essential for the decisionmaking process to create opportunities for local perspectives,” says The Sprout Fund’s Lewis Long. “For example, Somerset County representatives needed to consider Somerset County applications. And, in the same way, Regional applications needed to be reviewed through a regional lens.”

When it came time to create that decisionmaking process, however, Sprout was faced with a problem—albeit a good one: Community Connections had garnered 522 project applications, far more than had been expected. On September 14, 2007, the submission deadline, Sprout received an application every six minutes. They came in from across the spectrum of Southwestern Pennsylvania—both geographically, and in terms of project focus, with applicants ranging from churches and community organizations to museums, schools, and even farmers. One memorable application delivery—from Family Communications, Inc.—was an especially speedy delivery via Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood star Mr. McFeely.

Grassroots project applications—those requesting $5,000 or less for projects affecting a single community or county—were reviewed by panels of decisionmakers chosen from within each county, reflective of that county’s demographic makeup and nominated by county residents. Each decisionmaker rated project proposals based on criteria developed by The Sprout Fund, including anticipated impact on the community and intended audience; contributions to goals such as connecting communities and civic engagement; and of course, feasibility for success. Then, at decisionmaking forums, those applications were discussed and the funding decisions made by the panel members.

“A lot of the projects we reviewed, I’d never even heard of them,” says Michael Wright, executive director of Shenango Valley Urban League and a Grassroots decisionmaker for Mercer County. “And these were people right here in my backyard. It provided a whole new avenue for smaller or minority-run projects to find funding.”

By recruiting dozens of people like Wright, Community Connections helped ensure that Grassroots funding decisions were based on the specific needs and priorities of each county. With decisionmakers ranging from philanthropists to business people, state representatives to borough officials, academics and community organizers, the unique make-up of Southwestern Pennsylvania’s 14 counties was reflected in the constitution of the Grassroots decisionmaking panels.

All told, 88 Grassroots Projects received support totaling $418,750. Although, with more than 230 applica-tions vying for Regional Grants requesting up to $50,000 each, that decisionmaking process was even more rigorous.

To ensure that only the strongest candidates would be considered by decisionmakers, experts from a variety of fields reviewed Regional applications. In total, 75 expert reviewers from fields as diverse as education and agriculture, government and environmentalism, were brought in to help identify the projects with the highest potential for success. One of those reviewers, looking in particular at neighborhood development projects, was Wanda Wilson.

“I reviewed quite a few projects falling into two categories,” says Wilson, a program officer at the Pittsburgh Partnership for Neighborhood Development. “There was a cluster of projects that wanted to work on neighborhood improvement projects, and another cluster of projects that wanted to document the history of a community.”

“I evaluated projects against the criteria Sprout provided, which really led me to consider projects that would have an impact on the specific community and also meet broader goals,” says Wilson.

Once proposals were examined and rated by the expert reviewers, The Sprout Fund provided the top tier of proposals to the Regional Decisionmaking Panel. For the applicants who made it through this round of examination, there was one more step they had to take on their approach to receiving support.

At the Regional Decisionmaking Forum held in Pittsburgh on December 13, 2007, the 24 strongest Regional Grant candidates presented their ideas live before the decisionmakers from all counties. After each project was given a chance to make their case to the assembled body of decisionmakers, deliberations ensued and, after an exhaustive dialogue, 12 Regional projects were chosen to receive grants of up to $50,000.

JoAnn McBride, executive director of the Lawrence County Tourist Promotion Agency, served as one of the decisionmakers on the Regional panel. Through this experience, she felt she was able to make a positive impact not just for Lawrence County, but to keep in sight Community Connections’ goal of being truly regional.

“I thought all the projects we chose were really strong,” says McBride. “The rural communities around Pittsburgh are in constant contact, and we’re used to making compromises with Pittsburgh. Sometimes it feels like Pittsburgh muscles its way through, but not here. In this process, every county got something—it was a big regional effort, and I felt honored to be there.”

At the Regional decisionmaking forum, Fellows from the Coro Center for Civic Leadership in Pittsburgh mediated round-table discussions. To mediator and Coro alumna Sujata Shyam, the method was not only successful as a decisionmaking system, but also in revealing the extent of the region’s commitment to community progress.

“The process was amazing to see,” says Shyam, “the presentations by finalists, the round-table discussions, and the final large group discussion. It was an impressive operation to bring this group to consensus. I’d recently moved to Pittsburgh from San Francisco, and I was inspired by the projects that made it to the regional forum. It offered a fantastic perspective on civic engagement in this region.”

As senior producer at WQED-TV, Minnette Seate is no stranger to the world of nonprofit community programming. But Seate possesses another trait that made her perfect to act as a member of the Regional decisionmaking panel: She’s no sucker for jargon.

“I suppose I should call it ‘perspective,’ but I brought a lot of my own ‘baggage’ to the decisionmaking table,” says Seate. “I tried to be as even-handed as possible—but with a heaping teaspoon of reality.”

Yet by the end of the process, Seate had discovered another important aspect of the decisionmaking system. She saw dozens of individuals from around the region display ingenuity and passion for bettering their communities. And it brought her a new perspective on the region—one that left her “baggage” behind, and connected her more closely to the presenters, her fellow decisionmakers, and the places from which they all come.

“It opened my eyes to how Pittsburgh-centric I can be,” says Seate. “You forget sometimes that while others may vote or dress a bit differently than you, they want the same basic things for their communities that I do—just with a different dressing on it.”

## Awards and Allies

On the morning of December 19, 2007, more than 300 people gathered at the top of the Regional Enterprise Tower in Downtown Pittsburgh. At first glance, the attendees may not have seemed to have much in common. This disparate group included Pittsburgh business leaders in two-button suits and historical reenactors in 18th-century military uniforms; philanthropy professionals from the region’s south in Greene County and farmers from its north in Armstrong; community organizers from Homewood and Girl Scout leaders from Mercer County.

But as many of them learned that day, they certainly did have a lot in common. They had a firm belief in the potential of Southwestern Pennsylvania, and a bright idea of how to build a better future while celebrating the past as a part of Pittsburgh 250. What’s more, each had something in common—whether they were cleaning up a small community in Cambria County or building huge sculptures throughout the region: A Community Connections check had their name on it.

Once those checks were handed out, and the Regional Enterprise Tower cleared of guests, those projects shared something else: A year-long relationship with The Sprout Fund, which proceeded to act as sounding board, advocate, PR firm and general assistant to all 100 projects funded through Community Connections. If one of the important facets of Community Connections was its ability to empower new and inexperienced grassroots community activists by funding their projects, it would’ve been a grave mistake not to back up that funding with other kinds of support throughout the year.

As Sprout’s Community Connections Program Coordinator, Dustin Stiver found himself hitting the highways and byways of Southwestern Pennsylvania throughout 2008 in aid of the initiative’s projects.

“We knew from the outset that distributing checks was only the beginning of our work,” says Stiver. “Sprout has experience helping new projects move from ‘requests to results.’ It was important to work alongside project managers to equip them for success.”

Sometimes it was enough just to support a project by showing up, say, at the unveiling of a new beautification effort in Ambridge. Other times, that support role became more complex—advocating for the South Side Sculpture Project at public forums, or creating and issuing press releases and media requests for event-driven projects. Still others required something else entirely, such as when the Parker Postage Stamp Park called with a beguiling question: “What actually happens at a groundbreaking ceremony?”

Perhaps most importantly, Sprout was there—at the other end of the phone, out in the field, and through a monthly online newsletter—to keep reminding projects that they’re not alone. Through Community Connections, Sprout helped build a new regional network of committed partners, including community groups, or funding organizations, media outlets, and just regular folks willing to turn out and put in a few hours. Throughout 2008, the region would see this new network of Community Connections come alive to empower the people of Southwestern Pennsylvania.

With grant money in pocket, the 100 projects funded through Community Connections got down to business balancing their limited funds with their lofty goals. But just as Sprout and the Community Connections Committee had hoped, when community members were given the opportunity to direct funding as they saw fit, supported projects rose to the occasion.

Though different in scope, divergent in goals, diverse in audience, and distant in geography, these projects together comprise the story of Pittsburgh 250 Community Connections.
