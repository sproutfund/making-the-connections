# CHAPTER 06: Pathways

_Access. Appreciation. Conservation._

One of the long-standing ironies of Pittsburgh’s reputation is that, despite being known for so long as the smoky Steel City, one can travel a few miles in almost any direction out of the city’s center and escape into an idyllic countryside unlike that surrounding almost any other metropolitan area. This irony, however, is one that Western Pennsylvanians cherish: Those trails, waterways, ponds and fields are as much a part of the region’s identity as its industrial heritage or deep-rooted history.

As a part of Community Connections, many projects cut paths to increase the understanding of, and access to, the region’s outdoor amenities, be that miles outside of town or just around the corner. Because the depth of this region’s environmental beauty is something that Pittsburgh—perhaps because of its decades with smoke-darkened skies—never takes for granted.

> We’re not only making cleaner water here, we’re creating a new environment, a wetlands that’s teeming with life.

## Fishermen of Men

Sitting on the shore, Rodney Bryant points east, away from the boathouse and towards the deepest part of the lake in North Park, Allegheny County. That’s where he used to catch catfish and trout on his weekly trips to the park, he explains, “until I had my first heart attack, three years ago. I haven’t been here since. Not ‘til today.”

Bryant’s most recent trip to North Park, on a made-to-order sunny summer’s afternoon, wasn’t necessarily about catching fish. With Fisherman’s Tale, a Grassroots Project lead by the century-old senior-care organization Lemington Community Services (LCS), Bryant and over a dozen other African-American seniors—largely from the Lincoln-Lemington neighborhood of Pittsburgh—visited North Park to catch some rays, catch up with friends, and tell some stories. And if those stories happened to reflect on the state of their mental and physical health, LCS Executive Director Joy Starzl says, all the better.

“We’ve always had a guy’s night at the center, where the seniors come in and play cards and talk,” says Starzl. “We bring someone in to talk about an issue, but not to stand up and talk about it—they just sit around and play cards with the guys, and bring up things like grieving and depression. But the men stopped coming, so we thought, we need to expose them to this information. We did a survey, and they said, ‘we don’t wanna play cards—we want to go fishing!’”

Fisherman’s Tale brought the guy’s night outside. Along with the seniors, LCS took a few extra folks along on their trips: Doctors, psychologists, neighbors and friends who could casually chat with the fishermen and find out what’s really going on with them. Lincoln-Lemington, along with several other predominantly African-American neighborhoods in Pittsburgh from which LCS draws the majority of its clientele, is a rough place to be a senior citizen. A lack of amenities geared towards seniors, coupled with a high crime rate, tends to keep people isolated—which allows them to slip through the cracks too often. With the success of Fisherman’s Tale, LCS project coordinator Arnold Perry hoped that the project would help to stem that decline.

“We try to bring together people who too-often stay in their homes,” says Perry. “People need events like Fisherman’s Tale so that they don’t feel neglected and unwanted. Jesus told Peter to be a ‘fisherman of men,’ and that’s what we try to be.”

While the initial plan for the project was limited to senior citizens, the immediate appeal of Fisherman’s Tale allowed it to blossom much further. Thanks to a separate grant from Mount Ararat Baptist Church, Fisherman’s Tale began including children from Pittsburgh’s Paulson Community Center in their trips later in the summer. The addition leant a new element to the project’s title, allowing the seniors to tell their tales to a new generation of African-American youths.

“The kids that have come—I’m at a loss for words,” says Starzl. “They come and they listen to the guys, and afterwards, they tell their friends about it and their friends want to go, too. They want to go again and again. And that’s so important, because if we don’t get these guys to tell their stories, they will regret it, and one day the kids will regret it, too.”

## Rapids Ascent

When Frank Moone looks at the waterways that connect Southwestern Pennsylvania, it’s not bass, trout, or walleye he imagines, but the rapids, eddies and calms sought by kayakers and canoeists. As a board member with the Wild Waterways Conservancy, Moone helped to spearhead the Explore Western Pennsylvania’s Wild Waterways project, building boat launches for non-mechanized crafts throughout Beaver, Butler and Lawrence counties.

According to Moone, the Connoquenessing and Slippery Rock waterways offer a broad variety of paddling possibilities —from placid waters for the beginner to rapids for the experienced boater. The challenge for the conservancy has been to provide access to those waterways with minimal intrusion on the environment.

“Traditionally, boat launches are big concrete slab things that you back a truck onto,” says Moone. “We’re not interested in anything like that. Ours are made of native sandstone blocks, with steps or mulched trails, to carry a kayak down on. The idea is to encourage the use of the outdoors, but discourage improper use.”

Over the summer and fall of 2008, Wild Waterways built four launches on the Connoquenessing Creek, and a further launch on Slippery Rock Creek. The result is a fully accessible yet environmentally sound water trail, which not only serves the people of Southwestern Pennsylvania, but makes a new destination for kayaking and canoeing enthusiasts from all over the country.

“The launches on the Connoquenessing cover the bulk of the Connie water trail,” says Moone. “So now, if you’re a beginner and want flat water, we’ve got a space for you—you won’t have to paddle ten miles to get out of the water. But there’s another stretch—from Ellwood City Gorge to Rock Point—that’s serious Class 3 and Class 4 rapids, and it was hard to get in and out of the water there. This makes that available, and we expect a big influx of people; people who know what they’re doing, and who like a challenge.”

## Mine Control

Maybe it’s the pastoral setting, or the heightened awareness to the outdoors that comes with a sun-dappled day, but on a bright morning, the colors near the intersection of Tanoma Road and Rayne Church Road seem raised like ridges. There’s the dusty blacktop of Tanoma Road, the kind of rural Indiana County country lane that’s as much part of the landscape as a forest or farm; the green glint of rain-slickened grass; and then there’s the bed of the ravine—a rusty red more befitting Crayola than countryside.

“Anyone who grew up in the Pittsburgh area before about the mid-‘80s, they know these colors,” says Rebecca Slak, board member of the Evergreen Conservancy, pointing to a gusher of rust water spurting from the ground a hundred yards below—water pumped out by natural pressure from an abandoned mine deep below. The water’s metallic tint is from the tons of iron it has absorbed from the mine, which then flows down into Crooked Creek—a tributary of the Allegheny. By the time the Allegheny River hits Kittanning, the iron has entered the entire region’s water supply.

Or at least it would, but for a relatively simple, beautifully natural example of an Abandoned Mine Drainage treatment system. A quarter of a mile from the ravine sit three ponds, each almost unnoticeably lower than its predecessor, surrounded by streams and together creating a wetlands environment in the middle of coal country. With help from a Grassroots Grant, in the fall of 2008, the Evergreen Conservancy signposted a new trail around the Tanoma Wetlands, explaining its operations and its importance to the ecosystem of the region.

As visiting classes, Scout troops, and Sunday drivers can now discover for themselves, water contaminated and forced by natural pressure from the mine is directed into the first Wetlands pond, where iron sinks to the bottom—these tons of metals can be collected and recycled. As it slowly moves through the three ponds, the natural clumpings of Wetlands plants filter the water—the entire process is natural and simple, and requires almost no upkeep.

At the end of the third pond, the now-purified water trickles into a small stream that leads into Crooked Creek. As the new signage on the Tanoma Wetlands Educational Trail explains, the whole process not only makes the water safer for humans, it has allowed the local ecosystem to rebuild itself, and new life to flourish in this corner of Indiana County.

“This takes almost 150 pounds of iron out of Crooked Creek per day,” says Tom Clark, an environmental scientist with the Susquehanna River Basin. “That’s a whole person of iron every day. But we’re not only making cleaner water here, we’re creating a new environment, a wetlands that’s teeming with life.”
