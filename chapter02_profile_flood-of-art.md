# PROFILE: Flood of Art: John Stallings, Sculptor

The intersection of Haynes and Napoleon Streets in the Kernville neighborhood of Johnstown is the second-busiest intersection in Cambria County. It’s near the entrance to the city from Route 56—a route traveled by thousands every day, which makes husband-and-wife artists John and Cindy Stallings cringe, because the Haynes Street underpass is not pretty.

Neglect and population decline have made this location a renowned eyesore—which is one reason the Stallings targeted the intersection for the latest of John’s public sculptures, a massive circular form planted in a tiny new parklet, sponsored in part by a Grassroots Grant from Community Connections.

“Kernville isn’t just a blighted neighborhood,” says Cindy Stallings, “it’s the first impression of Johnstown—it’s right off of the Route 56 exit. It’s not only visitors’ first sight, but thousands of Johnstowners themselves see it every day.”

The Stallings weren’t the only ones thinking about revitalizing Kernville with the arts. When John and Cindy began talks with the city about their public sculpture proposal, they discovered that Kernville had been designated for renovation through the Johnstown Artist Relocation Program.

Using public art to spur urban redevelopment isn’t a new idea—it is, as an Americans for the Arts economic study determined in 2007, “an economically sound investment” for small towns as well as big cities, because “the arts mean business.” The City of Johnstown has taken this idea to heart, targeting artists with financial subsidies, pre-arranged mortgages and other incentives to lure them into Kernville. With the Relocation Program in mind, the Stallings have ramped up their plan to include further sculptures in other strategic Kernville locations, commissioned from regional and national artists. “It’s got to be something we’d consider ‘museum-quality’ artwork,” says John Stallings. “And hopefully this will become known as a place to really show your work.”

It’s a plan that has attracted a lot of supporters. Since being awarded a Grassroots Grant, the Stallings’ plan has seen other support come in from private companies as well as the Pennsylvania Rural Arts Alliance and the state’s Department of Community and Economic Development. Meanwhile, John Stallings was named the sole recipient of 2008’s George Sugarman Foundation grant, with the Foundation citing regional support for the Haynes Street project as an important part of their decision.

“This project’s been a lesson in seeing things grow,” says Cindy Stallings, “in how a seed can grow into something much bigger than we’d imagined. And in this case, the Community Connections grant was that seed.”
