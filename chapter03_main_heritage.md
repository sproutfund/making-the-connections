# CHAPTER 03: Heritage

_Restoration. Preservation. Legacy._

Southwestern Pennsylvania’s daily life is informed by 250 years of history— whether it’s Route 30 from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, first cut by General Forbes in 1758, or the backdrop of industrial heritage found near Pittsburgh today. When it came time to acknowledge the region’s 250th anniversary, naturally, many Community Connections projects incorporated history into their activities.

To some, the priority was on restoring and preserving physical artifacts like rescuing a 19th-century barn or preserving a restored theater from the Vaudeville Age. To others, it was the interpretation of history that mattered. For all of Community Connections’ historical projects, the overarching theme was one of continuity between the past and the future—ensuring that the first 250 years remain a foundation on which the next 250 years can be built.

## Old Bedford Village

Motorcycling along the highways of Pennsylvania, Roger Kirwin sees the ghosts of Redcoats cutting paths across the state’s landscape in 1758, laying the groundwork for a road still traveled today.

What’s not always so apparent is which history is on display at the Village. Despite the center’s direct link to the French and Indian War, visitors are just as likely to encounter people dressed in Confederate gray or Napoleonic-era uniforms.

“The thing about Old Bedford Village is its versatility,” says Kirwin, known to don a red coat himself as a French and Indian War reenactor. And it’s towards that end that the Village was awarded a Grassroots Grant to build its new pan coupe redan—a type of defensive structure used in the U.S. and Europe from the 1750s through the early-20th century.

With the redan’s addition, Old Bedford Village solidified itself as a premier location for living historians, no matter what era they cast themselves in. Those historians and hobbyists have responded in kind. Not only did groups of reenactors aid in the construction of the redan, the structure has attracted attention from hundreds who gleefully used this newly-added authenticity and attended 2008’s celebrations of Bedford’s 250th anniversary. And drawing those people to Bedford, says Kirwin, makes the Village a more dynamic educational and cultural amenity.

“When you can bring the places and characters of history to life, the public gets more interested,” says Kirwin. “It takes things out of the realm of academia and into a tactile, tangible understanding of history. We give living historians a marvelous canvas for reenactments, and, in return, they come here and give the public something to see.”


## Barn Storming

Whenever Jack Maguire saw a historic building in Saltsburg, Indiana County, threatened with demolition, he had a simple solution: Buy it. A commercial building from 1913, the old Academy built in 1851, the town’s high school—each time one of these buildings was targeted by the wrecking ball, Maguire bought it, refurbished it, and found contemporary uses that maintain the historical integrity of the building.

When talk began about pulling down the circa-1850 W.R. McIlwain Store and Warehouse, Maguire knew there’d be little public outcry. Because of its positioning along the once-busy canal, the dilapidated building has long been known by the less-than-impressive misnomer, “The Mule Barn,” as such buildings were common as housing for the animals that towed boats on the canal. (The fact that this storehouse likely never served that purpose is a moot point. As any Western Pennsylvanian can tell you, once a place is named, it stays named.)

A run-down local eyesore with “mule” in its name? Maguire knew that it’d take stubborn determination to win this one.

“It just doesn’t look good,” says Maguire, a semi-retired civil engineer and lifelong Saltsburg resident. “There’d been a fire at the back of the main structure, and the roof was collapsing. But, in my mind’s eye, I can see how it’d look if it was restored. And in Saltsburg, what you’ve got to do is just step forward and do the work—don’t just talk about it.”

Which is just what Maguire did: He volunteered to tear down the rear section of the Barn, to help “some of those eye-sore complaints go away.” With a Grassroots Grant acquired by Saltsburg Borough, Maguire and other volunteers stabilized the Barn, which had been listing to one side.

To Maguire and fellow preservationists, The Mule Barn represents an important part of Saltsburg’s history, dating from the mid-19th century when the Harrisburg-to-Pittsburgh canal went through town and beasts of burden pulled the barges. As Saltsburg Borough President Elizabeth Rocco says, were the Barn to go, “that’d be just one more piece of our history that we’ll never get back.”

It’s all part of what Jack Maguire calls “our historic fabric”—the future of which is in our hands. “History is one thing we really have to offer,” says Maguire. “And, believe me: people will be interested in these sites if they’re brought back.”

## Re-Covered Wagon

At the 50-acre Succop Conservancy, located on Route 8 just a few miles south of Butler, Director Nancy Lawry points out a former incubator from this property’s past as a chicken farm—now it’s a blacksmith’s shop for the Conservancy’s Heritage School. Here, no space or material is wasted: The previous owner’s swimming pool, filled in for safety reasons, became an herb garden; its bathhouse, the kitchen for outdoor events, refurbished with timber from cleared acreage.

This philosophy goes hand-in-hand with the Conservancy’s establishing directive, as laid out by Tom and JoAnn Succop when they donated their family farmland in 2001, to keep the land for education and environmental stewardship purposes in perpetuity.

So when the Conservancy pulled a pre-Civil War hay wagon from the farm’s early-19th century barn, it was only natural that its restoration should become part of the Conservancy’s mission. That didn’t mean the task would be easy. “It was in a dark corner of the barn, with a family of raccoons living in it,” says Lawry. “It’s hard to even think back to what it looked like.”

With help from a Grassroots Grant, the Conservancy assembled a Venturing Crew—a team of teenagers, working through Boy Scouts of America. With the Conservancy’s woodworking expert and blacksmith, that crew restored the wagon—forging new wheel spokes to replace broken ones, and touching up and painting the wooden frame. In the process, the crew learned hands-on lessons about how agricultural Butler was built 100 years ago.

It’s just the sort of skills that visitors will learn at the Heritage School, a new initiative that makes Succop Conservancy a destination for historical folk-trade education. Classes range from blacksmithing and woodworking to aromatherapy and Native American storytelling.

The wagon now plays an integral role in the life of the Conservancy, acting as its icon and a working transport for students, the Venturing Crew, or anyone participating in community activities like Butler County’s Master Gardeners events.

But perhaps the most important aspect of the project is the ongoing restoration work itself, illustrating the experiences of our ancestors.

“We’ve got the ability to use the wagon for community events, and for rides,” says Lawry. “But more than that, it’s just an important reminder of the farming heritage that made this area—and our country—what it is today.”

## Theater Dreams

When Denise Mihalick walks the aisles of the Arcadia Theater, built in 1921, she follows in famed footsteps: movie star Loretta Young, for example, and Depression-era film star Joan Blondell, both paced the Arcadia’s stage in its vaudeville days according to tickets stubs found in the building.

But as executive director of the Arcadia, located in Windber, Somerset County, Mihalick tempers those dreams of its heyday with nightmares of its dilapidated recent past. Photos of the Arcadia prior to its 1998 restoration show an interior brutally wracked by age and neglect, its ceilings caved in, its walls crumbling under their own weight.

Fortunately, today’s Arcadia is full of past glory. Restored to its gilded-age appearance, based on artifacts as small as a piece of long-gone carpeting or a photograph highlighting an exterior feature, the Theater is once again the crown jewel of the Windber area. And, with the recent memory of the Arcadia’s dilapidation in tow, Mihalick says the community is committed to keeping it that way. “The people of Windber are so proud of this theater,” says Mihalick. “To give you an example, I am the only paid employee—the entire theater is run by volunteers, from the box office to the ushers.”

Today, the Arcadia Theater has the success it needs to keep operating: According to Mihalick, monthly performances regularly sell out the 690-seat theater. But while ticket sales and sponsorships cover production expenses, the Arcadia’s needs for future renovation and preservation are, so far, unfunded.

“The building is 96 years old—we need a new roof, and everything from the constant need to upgrade technical equipment, to slowly replacing all the toilets. If we can raise enough money to start a sizable endowment, we’ll live off the interest whenever we need some capital improvements.”

With the help of a Grassroots Grant, the Arcadia kicked off its endowment campaign on October 25, 2008—nearly ten years to the day after its first post-restoration performance.

“We’ve become regional,” says Mihalick. “From Johnstown to Somerset to Altoona, our reputation isn’t just the quality and diversity of entertainment, but the warmth—the magical appearance of the theater. It’s referred to as the ‘gem of the area,’ but it’s not just the theater—when we have show nights, every restaurant is full, everything’s busy. And that can’t help but give visibility to the town.”

The anniversary fundraising gala was just a first step toward ensuring the lasting legacy of the Arcadia Theatre. And, if Mihalick has anything to do with it, there will be many more steps to come.
