# SIDEBAR: Life in the Past Lane

_The French and Indian War was all about movement. And when you move around Pennsylvania today, you trace those movements. You see woodlands that aren’t much different than they were 250 years ago. There are very few places left where you can look at history like that._

A burly, buck-skinned businessman stops through this territory frequently, setting up the tented trading post that displays his wares: muskets, ammunition, pipes and blankets, whatever the natives want in trade for the beaver and deer furs they’ve got in plenty. He might be based out of Fort Pitt, like so many traveling traders, but he doesn’t spend much time there—more often it’s North to the Iroquois or West to the Shawnee, to see what he can rustle up.

This is, of course, spinning a bit of a yarn—after all, it’s 2008, not 1758. But it’s easy to get caught up and forget that this is Boyce Park in Allegheny County—and that there’s a swing set just around the bend. The trading post is, in fact, just a stop along the trail of Washington’s Encampment, a Grassroots Project that brought 1758 to life for thousands of visitors from around the region and beyond.

During the Pittsburgh Celebrates 250 weekend, October 4–5, the Allegheny Foothills Historical Society took over Boyce Park in Plum Borough, turning it into an encampment based on that of General John Forbes and Colonel George Washington in the fall of 1758, when the two prepared to march into what is now Pittsburgh. Hundreds of French and Indian War reenactors—from Redcoats and George Washington to Native Americans and fur traders—converged on Washington’s Encampment, to illustrate the people and events that cut the Pittsburgh region as we know it out of the wilderness.

As Washington’s Encampment was underway, the Fort McIntosh Garrison was gearing up for an 18th-century event of its own. The Beaver County living-history unit, which specializes in the latter part of that century—and Western Pennsylvania’s Revolutionary War era—was badly in need of a refitting. (The 2008 economic crisis took its toll on gunpowder and uniform prices, too.) With a Grassroots Grant, the unit reorganized and revitalized its tools of the trade, debuting its new, historically accurate materials at an event in October.

The experience of living-history events such as Washington’s Encampment and Fort McIntosh is not so much immersion as it is education—a fact that rang out clearly. The kids started getting their basics straight—“Why were their guns so long?” “I thought the Redcoats were the bad guys?” Even some of the know-it-alls got schooled, too, in everything from the simple inner workings of a musket, to the complex intersection of historical changes—involving wealthy British industrialists and lowly North American fur traders alike—that illustrate how Pittsburgh came to be.
