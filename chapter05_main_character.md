# CHAPTER 05: Character

_History. Culture. Understanding._

Some Community Connections projects celebrated the poetic moments that make a community unique, whether in a single neighborhood, or the region as a whole. But to do so required imaginations that worked with equal poetry. Through film, drama, and community gatherings great and small, these projects prove that the Pittsburgh region is a place where symbols have strength: Where an image from a neighborhood, the words of a bygone era, or just a pair of sneakers and a sweater can conjure a new pride in the places we live.

> Something that really stands out about Pittsburgh is that all of the neighborhoods have a unique identity, and Pittsburghers have so much pride in that individual identity and experience

## Won’t You Be My Neighbor?

Ednan Alwan shakes his head—“no,” he doesn’t know who King Friday is, “But I know Mister Rogers.” Five-year-old Ednan points to a TV showing episodes of the PBS favorite, “and I know Neighbor Land!” He may have the name wrong, but when it comes to the neighborhood—be it the Neighborhood of Make-Believe or Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood—Ednan Alwan knows what he’s talking about. In a way, he lives there.

On March 20, 2008, on what would have been his 80th birthday, all of Southwestern Pennsylvania came together to celebrate the legacy of Fred Rogers for the culmination of Won’t You Be My Neighbor? Days—a week-long series of events organized by Family Communications, Inc., and supported by a Regional Grant. It’s hard to imagine Rogers’ legacy being fulfilled more emphatically than in the converted apartment in Pittsburgh’s Prospect Park neighborhood, where Ednan and a dozen other children from this immigrant-heavy part of town had gathered.

The apartment acts as an integrated neighborhood base for the Greater Pittsburgh Literacy Council’s Family Literacy Program. It was here that Ednan’s mother, Hakima, learned English when she emigrated from Morocco eight years ago. Now she works for the Literacy Council, watching the kids as other parents—many of them political refugees from Burma, Burundi, and other far-flung locales—take English lessons. On Rogers’ birthday, the apartment was packed with kids and their parents; food, games, and—of course—a TV showing episode after episode of Mister Rogers to an audience of rapt viewers.

Won’t You Be My Neighbor? Days had many components: the groundbreaking for a new Fred Rogers statue on Pittsburgh’s North Shore, big birthday bashes at the city’s North Side museums and smaller ones in Rogers’ hometown of Latrobe. There, local librarians quietly donned Fred’s signature sweaters and sneakers as part of a worldwide Sweater Day—an effort to recognize Fred Rogers’ achievements through the symbols he made his own—with sweater drives for the needy, open houses, and more.

Since Fred Rogers’ passing in February, 2003, the Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh has paid tribute to the city’s favorite neighbor by opening its doors for free on his birthday. To celebrate Pittsburgh 250, Family Communications saw the opportunity to widen that effort to a region-wide event commemorating Mister Rogers’ legacy of inclusivity.

Viewed from the cold perspective of statistics, Neighbor Days was obviously successful in its attempt to get families out to the region’s wonderful amenities in order to bring Pittsburghers together. The Children’s Museum recorded that 2,450 children visited that day—one of the best-attended days of their 25-year existence—and the story was the same at more than 70 other participating organizations and venues across the region. Project partner Tickets for Kids provided 450 free tickets to children for further events, and 5,000 books were distributed to kids from regional libraries.

But even though Fred Rogers knew his program reached thousands of kids, he always imagined neighborhoods built by approaching one kid at a time, and making sure they understood, “You are special.” According to Margy Whitmer, a longtime producer of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood at Family Communications, the kind of small-scale event at Prospect Park might’ve been closest to Rogers’ legacy.

“A lot of people who grew up watching the show, have kids who watch it now, and they finally get why they liked it so much,” says Whitmer. “Kids need someone that makes them believe, ‘he’s talking to me.’ They need a one-to-one feeling; that empathy.”

Through components both large and small, Neighbor Days brought the people of Pittsburgh together, and made that kind of empathy just a little more possible. What seems most important is a child like Ednan Alwan seeing himself a little bit closer—to his mother, his neighborhood, his city and his region.

“That’s what we hoped for,” says Whitmer, “that, through this project, people would become more connected to their neighbors in positive ways. That’s what Fred was always about—relationships.”

## Forging Alliances

In the long-dormant dramatic adaptation of Out of this Furnace, Thomas Bell’s classic novel of immigration and labor in turn-of-the-last-century Braddock, Allegheny County, prejudice against Eastern European mill workers is part of everyday life. That’s a history most Pittsburghers know well. But the immigrant experience in Pittsburgh continues to be a vital part of the region’s ongoing history—just look at Ednan and Hakima Alwan, and their neighbors in Prospect Park.

In addition to producing a revival of Out of this Furnace for Pittsburgh 250, with the help of a Grassroots Grant, Unseam’d Shakespeare Company examined immigrant labor and discrimination as continuing issues—not just pieces of history. To do so the Company commissioned two new plays: Wali Jamal’s Braddock 76, about the African-American experience in 1970s Braddock, and Anya Martin’s Teatro Latino de Pittsburgh, about the contemporary Latino immigrant experience in the region.

The tale of Braddock 76 is a Shakespearean juxtaposition of a young, black, motherless boy falling in love with a young, Slavic, fatherless girl. The twist? Each one’s parent is running for mayor of Braddock: he to be the first black mayor, she to be the first woman—a rather familiar electoral scenario in 2008. This allowed playwright Jamal to explore issues central to ’70s Braddock: race relations, gender inequality, and the role of labor unions. Braddock 76 also draws from the collective memory of Braddock’s residents as told in oral histories gathered by Jamal and Unseam’d Shakespeare.

Similarly, to create Teatro Latino de Pittsburgh, Martin engaged a group of Latino immigrant students from area high schools. Using contemporary theater techniques aimed at “teaching how to write theater, not just on the page, but in time and space,” as Martin puts it, as well as oral histories and interviews with Latino immigrants, Martin discovered that today’s immigration stories closely resemble the days of Out of this Furnace.

“The two stories don’t just intersect, they’re almost the same,” says Martin. “People are still coming for the same reasons: For a better life for their families, and because most feel like they don’t have a choice. People see this city as earnest, honest, and hard-working, and that’s a big part of this community’s traditions; blue-collar and family-oriented.”

With the revival of Out of this Furnace, Director Marci Woodruff sought to keep the play relevant for today’s theater crowd, and also to bring to the stage a performance that could lure newcomers to drama with a snapshot of their ancestors’ world. And the Unseam’d Shakespeare Company succeeded at this goal beyond their dreams: Every performance, including the two weeknight staged readings, sold out.

The result was a different look at the city’s identity through Pittsburgh’s immigrant history, in what Woodruff saw as a profound opportunity for social change.

“I believe in the power of theater to change people,” says Woodruff. “If you can make people think for an hour that they’re poor if they’re not, or black if they’re white—you can begin to change minds.”

## Reliable Narrator

Pittsburgh’s Strip District neighborhood is a kind of neutral ground—the market territory where, on a busy Saturday morning, the city’s wealthy and famous walk side-by-side with tourists, ordinary Joe’s, and the far-less-fortunate. It’s where Steelers players, for example, mingle with fans, so it’s no real surprise to see legendary wide receiver Louis Lipps dropping a dollar into the cup of a panhandler dressed head-to-toe in fur-trimmed black-and-gold: Steelers Santa. Nor is it a surprise when The Strip’s long-standing “Flute Man” takes a break from busking to call out: “Louis Lipps with another touchdown!”

The difference is that Steelers Santa isn’t actually a panhandler, but actor Tommy Lafitte, portraying Steelers Santa for producer (and long-time Strip District business owner) Ray Werner’s short film “Tommy and Me,” the tale of a homeless man’s difficult, but ultimately precious role in this high-visibility neighborhood. The flautist’s shouts just go to prove that Werner and director Gregory Lehane have got every quirky detail of this neighborhood down pat.

And that’s the key to Greetings from Pittsburgh: Neighborhood Narratives, the omnibus feature-film project, supported by a Grassroots Grant, of which “Tommy and Me” is but one part: nine films that each exemplify a specific Pittsburgh neighborhood.

In many ways, those neighborhoods reflect the same kind of uniqueness that the region’s small towns do. And just as Community Connections sought to highlight the region by networking those disparate places, Neighborhood Narratives shows that—once brought together—these unique stories combine to say something about Pittsburgh.

“Each individual film expresses what it really means to be in that particular neighborhood,” says Neighborhood Narratives project co-coordinator Kristen Lauth Shaeffer. “Pittsburghers have so much pride in their individual neighborhood identity and experience, and that’s something we wanted to really capture.”

In 2007, Shaeffer and Andrew Halasz were both students finishing MFA degrees in film at Chatham College. It was when discussing the recent omnibus feature Paris J’Taime—for which a group of famed directors created short pieces about Paris neighborhoods—that they realized that Pittsburgh could be seen through a similar lens.

“Something that really stands out about Pittsburgh is that all of the neighborhoods have a unique identity,” says Shaeffer. “So we thought Pittsburgh would be an ideal location for a project like Paris J’Taime. And because it was Pittsburgh 250—the timing just worked perfectly.”

The pair assembled an advisory committee of local film-world icons—Lightning Over Braddock filmmaker Tony Buba, The Bread, My Sweet director Melissa Martin, and Women in Film and Media Executive Director Faith Dickinson—and began soliciting treatments. In seeking films about specific neighborhoods, the obvious route might have been documentaries, but the project leaders made an early decision to stick entirely to fictional narrative films.

Like in Gabrielle Reznek and Sam Turich’s “Mombies,” an uproarious satire of the gentrification of Lawrenceville by grown-up hipsters, which looks at the phenomenon of Pittsburgh’s new family-oriented artsy crowd through the region’s most famous film tradition: zombie flicks. Or, as in “Milk Crate,” John Rice’s film about a lifelong South Side resident whose neighbor—a young Japanese man and recent South Side transplant—makes the cultural faux pas of moving the crate used to mark the South Sider’s parking space.

“How do you capture that in a documentary film?” says Shaeffer. “But John is a South Sider, and he’s written about that unspoken understanding, and being the person coming in who doesn’t know the rules.”

Other films in Neighborhood Narratives include Tim Hall’s film about the Hill District—comprised entirely of still photographs—and Jenn Golling and Matthew Fridg’s story of a long-subdued love discovered in Homestead’s library. In the sequence’s last film, called simply “Regent Square,” Nelson Chipman and Jeremy Braverman place a transplanted New Yorker in the eponymous neighborhood and expose him to neighborly traditions like welcome baskets and front-porch happy hours—much to his chagrin.

Neighborhood Narratives’ debut screening at Pittsburgh Filmmakers’ Regent Square Theater sold out in advance, and the project never looked back: Each of eight subsequent screenings, in the other eight represented neighborhoods, also sold out, calling for an encore run of five further screenings during the holidays.

Those neighborhood screenings—and the collaborations with community spaces and organizations that made them happen—marked one of the most important aspects of Neighborhood Narratives: That each film shows the indelible mark of its neighborhood, but also speak to the city’s identity as a whole.

“These films aren’t connected in terms of character, or story,” says Shaeffer. “But together, the project forms a tapestry of the city—a feature film that tells what it means to live in Pittsburgh.”
