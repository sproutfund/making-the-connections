# A Letter from the Chairman of Pittsburgh 250: A Regional Perspective

It’s been 250 years since Pittsburgh’s founding fathers imagined a new future here in Southwestern Pennsylvania, christening the town and setting in motion the events that would lead to the Pittsburgh region that we know today. Since then, this region has enjoyed a richness of history and a diversity of populations and experiences rarely matched by its neighboring American cities.

With Pittsburgh 250, we have celebrated that past and looked to the region’s future with events and projects both large and small—from the nationally regarded Tour of Pennsylvania race and PNC Legacy Trail Ride, to homecomings and community gatherings of all shapes and sizes. As a major component of that commemoration, Community Connections helped 100 projects across the 14-county region to create their own ways to illuminate their past and imagine their future anew, bringing Pittsburgh 250 the broadest base of participation possible.

Pittsburgh 250’s theme—Imagine What You Can Do Here—is about connecting the people inside and outside of this region to the vast wealth of ideas, amenities, and possibilities that Pittsburgh prizes as its greatest resources. As you’ll see in the following pages, Community Connections helped accomplish that goal in a broad range of meaningful ways, across an impressive geographic area.

I’d like to thank the hundreds of people who took part in Community Connections for helping to make Pittsburgh 250 as great a success as it was, and to encourage them to take those new ideas and connections forward into Pittsburgh’s next 250 years. Making the Connections is the story of a region and its citizens, and how they came together to celebrate their joint history by propelling their communities forward. I hope it helps you to think about the Pittsburgh region in a new light, and to imagine what you too can do here.
