# CHAPTER 04: Landscape

_Appearance. Beautification. Pride._

Unlike some community projects, revitalization efforts often come with the satisfying immediacy of a visible result. There are statistically calculable and physically tangible outcomes—16 tons of garbage picked up by one Homewood clean-up; a new green space to accompany the nascent library in Millvale; a blueprint to work from in a new Johnstown recreational area.

But when Khalif Ali grins his satisfied smile, it’s about something more than the garbage bags—stuffed full and piled high—collected by the volunteers at his Homewood Redd Up. And not just any patch of grass can make Brian Wolovich beam with pride, only one with as much history behind it as Millvale’s. Ali, Wolovich, and community organizers around the region spend their weekends changing the appearance of their neighborhoods not just to make them look different, but to change the way they’re viewed. And, by reshaping that vision, Community Connections became a way to change the expectations of residents and visitors alike.

> On the surface, we’re cleaning up the community, but what we’re really doing is building social capital. When people come and participate, they see our neighborhood in a different light.

## In a Different Light

Standing on a small park embankment in Pittsburgh’s Homewood neighborhood, Khalif Ali—a coordinator with a local community organization, Operation Better Block—clutches a microphone like a natural. Organizing his small army of volunteers, Ali isn’t so much general as master of ceremonies, elevating his orders—the distribution of work gloves, rakes, industrial-strength garbage bags—into a kind of Saturday morning stage patter. “Yeah, I know,” he says, smiling to the assemblage, “I love the mic.”

The crowd Ali addresses is eccentric: blurry-eyed college students stand beside senior citizens and community activists. The ringleader of one Homewood church group nudges City Councilman Bill Peduto about a few of the community’s needs, while members of a University of Pittsburgh fraternity collect the tools they’ll need to join in the day’s Homewood Redd Up—the biannual community clean-up (named for the Pittsburgh-via-Scotland colloquialism meaning “to tidy up”), sponsored in 2008 by a Grassroots Grant. Unlike some Pittsburgh neighborhoods, cleaning up Homewood isn’t just a battle against litter, as Ali’s instructions illustrate.

“Make sure your group has one of these syringe bottles,” Ali announces. “You’ll need them when you find needles—and you will find needles.”

Homewood is a tough neighborhood, beset by poverty, drugs, and gangs, and cleaning it up requires a passionate dedication. Operation Better Block joined forces with organizations in more affluent East End neighborhoods to form the Homewood-Squirrel Hill-Point Breeze Redd Up Coalition. The coalition brought people together from neighborhoods that might be only a few blocks apart geographically, but sometimes seem worlds apart culturally. As Executive Director Aliya Durham explains, the Redd Up is about so much more than just clean streets and parks.

“On the surface, we’re cleaning up the community, but what we’re really doing is building social capital,” says Durham. “Afterwards, while volunteers share lunch together, they’re talking to one another—it raises the visibility of our neighborhood; shows that there are so many good people who live here. When people come and participate, they see our neighborhood in a different light.”

It’s not just volunteers from all over the East End that get a new picture of Homewood thanks to the Redd Up; Homewood residents—from all walks of life—get a different view of their neighborhood when they see their neighbors and fellow Pittsburghers investing in the community. Durham recounts one story of a senior citizen from Squirrel Hill assigned to clean a particularly “tough intersection, with open drug dealing.”

“I know the neighborhood, and I was uncomfortable with where she was,” says Durham. “I stopped to check on her, and she said some guys had come out on the corner, ‘But I talked to them and told them I needed to clean it up, and they moved out of the way.’ ”

When people from other places show an interest in a neighborhood, it changes the psychology of the whole community.

“And that,” says Durham, “changes everything.”

## Cambrian Garden

There is a folktale that persists from the glory days of Ebensburg—the late-19th-century period when the small Cambria County town, 30 miles north of Johnstown, served as summer home and getaway for the robber barons of Pittsburgh. Looking over the workers preparing her garden for a wedding, an aristocratic matriarch announced from her porch, “Cut the hedges low so that the natives may watch.”

Walking through the doors of the Cambria County Historical Society’s museum, visitors encounter this folktale inscribed on a card and posted near the museum’s entrance. Which is appropriate, if tongue-in-cheek: It’s with a similar mission, though from a more populist perspective, that the Society invites “the natives” into the magnificent A.W. Buck House for a new exhibit of Ebensburg’s history.

Welcoming visitors to the building are the carefully trimmed hedges of the site’s new Victorian-era garden—recreated in detail from period photographs by Kendall-O’Brien, a Pittsburgh-based firm of landscape architects with ties to Ebensburg, with help from a Grassroots Grant.

The house was purchased by the Society in 1990—after 50 years as a private home, and 50 years as a convent. But while the interior was restored to its 19th-century state in 2000, the house’s exterior remained staunchly 20th-century—an annoyance to an organization intent on replication of a historical era.

“None of the period photos show the whole yard, but from other artifacts you get a good picture of it,” says Historical Society Secretary Dave Huber. “We have an etching of the house from 1890, with a lot of detail. You can see the courtyard centerpiece, and the whole property had a six-foot-tall wrought-iron fence.”

The fence, hedges, and courtyard have all been recreated from the pieced-together surviving images. The courtyard, crowned by an arbor under which visitors now enter, and containing iron benches and lawn urns, has become the focal point of the museum’s exterior, and provides an outdoor setting in which visitors can gather. It has another purpose, as well: to aesthetically connect the Buck House to Ebensburg’s downtown, just six blocks away.

“We really strived to tie this in to the recent downtown revitalization, which had a Victorian theme,” says Huber. “Similar trees, similar iron work—we’re hoping that will help lead people into the museum from downtown.”

## Bridge to the Future

It was a seemingly minor incident that brought change to the small Beaver County borough of Ambridge. In 2006, the borough’s lone street sweeper broke down, leaving the tenants of Ambridge’s Merchant Street business district to watch as leaves and litter piled up. Rebecca Sciulli-Carlson and her family were among those business owners.

“I’m tethered to Ambridge,” says Sciulli-Carlson. “My family owns a small appliance business—we’ve operated it for four generations now. And when the street sweeper broke, everyone was lamenting it—so we just started going out there every Sunday and cleaning a mile and a half of Merchant Street, just walking block-by-block.”

It would be hard to find an example of post-industrial America more poetic than that of Ambridge: Employment and living standards dropped sharply there in the 1970s, culminating in 1983’s closing of American Bridge’s operations, the company for which Ambridge was named. What followed were two decades of rethinking by politicians and community activists, a process that Sciulli-Carlson believes has now led to the current plan to revitalize using brownfield spaces such as the location of the former H.H. Robinson steel mill. With recent international investments by Australian entrepreneur Robert Moltoni, Sciulli-Carson says, “People in Ambridge began to think, ‘yes, we really can change our future.’”

So when the newly dubbed Committee to Clean and Beautify Ambridge hit the streets to clean up each Sunday, other Ambridge locals began joining in. The group’s ranks swelled from five initial volunteers to its current membership of over 30, and when the street sweeper came back online, the organization—with Sciulli-Carlson as its chair—began looking for other opportunities.

“We began looking at the gateways to Ambridge, with help from Western Pennsylvania Conservancy,” says Sciulli-Carlson. First, the group built up the park space around a World War II-era anchor positioned near the entrance into town from Route 65. Then the Conservancy suggested adding a water feature at P.J. Caul Park, another heavily trafficked gateway into the city. “We said, ‘yeah—a water feature,’” laughs Sciulli-Carlson. “We couldn’t afford the plastic bags we were using for trash!”

So the Committee continued building relationships—with businesses like Value Ambridge Properties and the New Economy Business Park, that had an interest in revitalizing the communities they serve, and with public entities such as Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, which contributes materials to the organization.

Now, according to Sciulli-Carlson, over 100 people are directly or indirectly involved in working with the organization. And when Pittsburgh 250 was announced, the Committee secured a Grassroots Grant to finally finish their second “Gateway to Ambridge,” complete with a refreshing water sculpture. The rest of the park came together with hours upon hours of volunteer time from the community, including substantial overtime from the water feature’s builder, Ambridge resident Rob DeMacio. And that community participation is, perhaps, the most important part.

“It’s had such a positive response from the whole community,” says Sciulli-Carlson, “and, as a result, it encourages others to do the same kind of thing.”


## The Domino Effect

Millvale resident Brian Wolovich can rattle off a list of local cultural landmarks befitting a town twice its size. “We’ve got Pittsburgh’s best French bakery; Kitman’s famous furniture store; the Lincoln Diner—where Pamela’s restaurants started; Riverfront Park; The Attic record store and Mr. Small’s Theater, which are both world famous.”

But Wolovich, a teacher at Quaker Valley Middle School, will also be the first to tell you what this Allegheny River town just outside Pittsburgh is lacking—and it’s a list at least as long. Besides the dwindling population, loss of businesses, and unemployment common to many similar former mill towns, much of Millvale sits in a flood plain.

“When Hurricane Ivan hit in 2004, we had everyone from local government to George W. Bush come here and make promises,” says Wolovich—but much like Katrina in the Gulf Coast, the real shock was the lack of help afterwards. “Everyone came back again after the floods in August of 2007. At least that woke up the media, asking why those 2004 promises weren’t kept.”

That’s why Wolovich joined with a few friends and family members to form New Sun Rising, a nonprofit organization with lofty goals to revitalize Millvale—most notably, creating the Millvale Library, which began operating in the summer of 2008. But while the impact of Millvale having its own local library is obvious, another aspect of the project takes a more subtle tact. With the Grant Avenue Pocket Park, funded by a Grassroots Grant, New Sun Rising has opened up a patch of park land near the library, in the middle of Millvale’s business district.

“Millvale’s not the most relaxing place in the world,” says Wolovich. “The best amenity we have is Riverfront Park, but it’s severed from the community by Route 28, a busy four-lane highway. The green space will have so many benefits, but most of all, it’s just a place for people to relax.”

Like the Homewood Redd Up, the library and green space have provided opportunities to show residents and visitors a new face of Millvale. New Sun Rising has hosted volunteers from as far away as Florida to work on its projects, besides bringing together local activists and community organizers to see the potential that Millvale holds. Beyond simply providing a breather for people already in the community, Wolovich sees the green space as the next stage in building a new Millvale—a place that can take advantage of its low cost of living and opportunities for home ownership, and begin to bring new families into the community to buy houses and invest in the neighborhood.

“If you buy it, you care for it more,” says Wolovich. “Millvale has a much higher-than-average percentage of renters, so you see houses falling into disrepair. I think combinations like the library and the green space, they impact people’s interest in buying into the community. Young families can afford to buy a house here, so I see it having a domino effect.”

## A Job Begun

Bill Horner passes his hand along a worn gravestone, reading the words as he touches them: “Jacob Horner,” he says. “Founder and Proprietor of Sandyvale Cemetery.”

The shared surname is no coincidence, nor is the name of the location—Sandyvale sits in a neighborhood of Johnstown, Cambria County, called Hornerstown, named for Bill’s ancestors, including Jacob. Although burials here date back to the Revolutionary War era, the other gravestones at Sandyvale are few in number and random in location—the result of Johnstown’s famous floods in 1889, 1936, and 1977. A few trees and some weathered statuary dot the landscape, where dog-walkers and joggers frequent circular paved trails at lunchtime.

Standing in the middle of Sandyvale Cemetery Memorial Garden there’s little to signal the ambitious changes that Horner, Diana Kabo, and the rest of the Sandyvale Cemetery Association board members have in mind for this plot of hallowed ground. But Sandyvale is about to see its landscape overhauled again—this time, not by the chaos of floodwaters, but by careful planning executed by dedicated stewards.

The plans for Sandyvale are remarkable. There’s a hiking-and-biking trail that runs along the Cemetery’s perimeter to link up with established trails such as the Path of the Flood Trail and the James Mayer Riverwalk. A disused barn at the land’s edge, donated to the Association, is ready to be transformed into a visitor’s center. And long-range plans include multiple botanical gardens and an arboretum. To Horner, it’s all part of a renaissance in Johnstown.

“This is a city in transition,” says Horner. “Steel’s gone, coal is somewhat gone, now it’s defense and information technology that run this area. But people are really taken with the quality of life here, and that’s what this project impacts.”

Horner and Kabo stress that the master plan they’ve produced will take years to complete. But thanks in part to a Grassroots Grant to get 2008’s planning phase and initial work underway, Bill Horner can already imagine his predecessors’ glee.

“What we needed was to start,” says Horner. It’s a sentiment echoed throughout community efforts working to revitalize through beautification—from Allegheny to Beaver to Cambria and beyond.

“It’s like my father always used to say,” says Horner, “‘A job begun is a job half done.’”
