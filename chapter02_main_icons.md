# CHAPTER 02: Icons

_Impressions. Expressions. Visions._

The creation and implementation of a work of public art can signal many things. It can be a step in a larger community effort, symbolizing pride in the neighborhood, or a commemoration of cultural and historical events that transpired therein. Sometimes the act of making the artwork itself is enough reason to proudly display its final product, created out of the raw talents and materials of the community.

Amongst the public art projects funded by Community Connections, certain artistic themes reappeared again and again: a permanence of concept and materials; pride of history in an act of forward progress; and, the contemplation of location and integration into community. But, perhaps most excitingly, none of these projects resulted in art unable or unwilling to stand the test of time. These icons will remain by the roads and trails of the region for years to come.

## Captains of Industry

Even in the bright sunshine of summer, entering the former LTV Steel coke-works along the Monongahela River near Pittsburgh’s Hazelwood neighborhood can be somewhat intimidating. Past a cobwebbed guard’s kiosk, one slowly drives down disused roads and into the mile-long building that once housed the works’ rolling mill, where an iron giant, 20 feet tall, looms shadowy and watchful. This is zombie territory: the scorched earth and Frankenstein’s monsters of the post-industrial age.

To acclaimed Pittsburgh artist Tim Kaulen, it’s all raw material—from the scraps stacked in one corner of the mill, to the histories and myths that surround the city’s industrial lore. With the other members of the Industrial Arts Co-Op, Kaulen has spent 10 years helping to forge the rusted detritus and proud iconography of Pittsburgh’s industrial history into a monumental work—the South Side Sculpture Project. The sculpture is a multi-story-tall diorama of two steel workers built from pieces of the original nearby Hot Metal Bridge, framing an industrial crucible, its rim overrun with metal frozen in mid-pour.

The surroundings may seem intimidating initially, but it’s obvious that Kaulen is as comfortable in the LTV site’s massive studio space as in his living room. Arms crossed, ignoring the nearby welder’s torches and nerve-rattling balanced girders, Kaulen shakes his head as his dog, Eli, runs around with a wooden spool, trying to lure a playmate. It ought to be comfortable after a decade’s work.

“The Industrial Arts Co-op was commissioned for this by the City in 1998,” as a central artwork for a new riverfront shopping area, says Kaulen. “It was meant for the Southside Works, which was in the planning stage.”

At that time, the Southside Works was only an idea—a shopping and living development on the brownfield space that once housed the Jones &amp; Laughlin steel mill. With the site’s history in mind, the Co-op—a group of artists interested in large-scale public artwork—chose its subject matter and materials from that industrial heritage.

The group solicited a number of donations from the industry itself. Scrap metal from the LTV and Jones &amp; Laughlin sites, salvaged from the recycling process, went to build the workers and their “armor,” as Kaulen describes it: “A layer of metal, like protective gear. It’s meant to get away from the architectural geometry of the figures—make them appear more organic.” A Youngstown company donated a used hot-metal ladle—the ten-foot-tall, bucket-like iron piece that serves as the sculpture’s centerpiece.

But the same things that make the sculpture compelling—it’s larger-than-life scale, and time-weathered, permanent materials—created difficulties for the Co-op artists. Early into the process, it became clear that, while the city was interested in housing the piece at the Works, there was not a dedicated piece of land for it to reside on.

“There was never a specified site,” says Kaulen, “but we decided to build it without the site, because we just wanted to make the art.”

The LTV site in which the Co-op works, now owned by a consortium of foundations called the Almono Limited Partnership, is a godsend, according to Kaulen. It may be “freezing in winter, and too hot in summer,” but its height and width makes the Co-op members uniquely able to work cheaply on the kinds of scale their work encompasses. The problem, however, has been in moving the piece, and reassembling it on its final South Side location. That’s where the Regional Grant from Community Connections came in, providing money to finish work on the sculpture, and help transplant the multi-ton structure to its permanent home—and in doing so, create a new icon for future generations of Pittsburghers.

## Driving Ambitions

Scale, permanence, histories of industry and a transitioning economy: When Olga Herbert talks about the public art project she’s working on for the Lincoln Highway Heritage Corridor (LHHC), her language echoes that of the Industrial Arts Co-op. Not surprising, considering the geographic regions and historical eras that Herbert, as executive director of LHHC, deals with.

In its heyday, from 1913 until the opening of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1940, the Lincoln Highway was the primary East-West corridor through the state—part of a transcontinental road, Herbert is quick to point out, “ten years older than Route 66, and twice as long!” And unlike so much of Route 66, you can still get your kicks driving the entirety of the Lincoln Highway today from Times Square to San Francisco.

Pennsylvania’s portion of the Highway is dotted by small towns that once brimmed with the roadside bustle that befit the country’s prime thoroughfare, but which have fallen into economic and historical quietude since the coming of the Turnpike seven decades back. The LHHC exists, according to Herbert, to help promote economic development through tourism along the least populated portion of Pennsylvania’s Lincoln Highway, from the Allegheny-Westmoreland County line to York County, over 200 miles away.

As part of that mission, the LHHC established the Roadside Giants of the Lincoln Highway project. With support from a Regional Grant, the LHHC partnered with four technical schools around the Western Pennsylvania region to create a series of Roadside Giants—huge, architectural structures in the form of commercial objects. It’s a practice with a long history along the Lincoln Highway, the best-known example of which is Bedford County’s Giant Coffee Pot.

“These people living along the Highway were real entrepreneurs,” says Herbert. “The question was always, ‘all these cars are passing by—how do I get people to stop at my place?’ So what started out as a roadside fruit stand, or a place to get water, kept getting bigger and bigger, and eventually wound up being these quirky roadside buildings, often put up over the course of a weekend.”

Students at the partnering schools designed and constructed a sculpture for their area’s portion of the Highway. In doing so, the students gained valuable inter-disciplinary experience—the graphic design students handing concepts off to welders; the process moving on to the building-trade students, “who might say, ‘there’s not enough steel in the world to do this!’” It’s a collaborative working environment that served to impart practical real-world knowledge to the participating students and enrich their learning experiences.

The finished pieces will each become iconographic for their locality: a Packard—the iconic car of the Lincoln Highway age—in Greensburg, Westmoreland County, created by Central Westmoreland Career and Technology Center in New Stanton, or a tandem bicycle in the town of Somerset—alluding to their many cycle trails—crafted by Somerset County Technology Center. But there’s also a unifying aspect to the Roadside Giants. There’ll be no missing these structures, and no doubting that you’re riding on the age-old Lincoln Highway.

“Some people tend to disregard this kind of architecture,” says Herbert, “but it’s programmatic architecture: yeah, they stick out, that’s what they’re supposed to do.”

## Leading Trailers

On the outskirts of Connellsville, in Fayette County, sit three 30-foot tall silos, each containing one of three substances used to make glass. When Chris Galiyas was asked to prime the silos for painting in 2008, he figured that’d be the beginning and end of his job. As a house painter, as well as a creative artist and West Mifflin art teacher, it’s the kind of job Galiyas has done innumerous times. But standing on that scaffolding, day after day, Galiyas got to talking to the dozens of people he’d see hiking and biking on the Great Allegheny Passage, the 150-mile D.C.-to-Pittsburgh trail that winds near the silos.

“Prepping the silos, I saw hundreds of people going by each day on the Trail,” says Galiyas. “I asked some people, ‘what’s it about’ and ‘how often do you use it,’ and a few people each day would say they use it every day, 365 days per year. So I had this idea for the silos—about the four seasons, and how Connellsville changes. I submitted a drawing and a mock-up, and my idea got picked!”

Galiyas’ painting—images of the seasons, rendered on a huge scale on the sides of the silos—is part of a chain of public artworks up and down the Great Allegheny Passage, at least one in each of the six Trail Towns on Western Pennsylvania’s portion of that now-famous path. The Progress Fund, a Laurel Highlands economic development agency and the Trail Town Program’s parent organization, received a Regional Grant to create new works of public art that express each town’s vision for itself, using a strategy based on The Sprout Fund’s Public Art program that matches communities with local artists to create permanent, collaborative works of art in public places.

The result was a broad range of artworks in an equal breadth of media: murals and sculptures in Confluence, Meyersdale and Rockwood in Somerset County; a sculpture made of railroad spikes in West Newton, Westmoreland County; and, in Fayette County, Connellsville’s silos and trail-spanning arch, and three large etched stones in Ohiopyle. (Connellsville and Rockwood also received Grassroots Grants to further enhance their projects.)

Several of the pieces rely on themes of industrial legacy similar to those of the South Side Sculpture Project and Roadside Giants projects. Scott Hostettler’s sculpture of a steam locomotive in Rockwood is one such example. Built out of metal and repurposed bicycle parts, Hostettler’s sculpture literalizes the “rails-to-trails” concept behind the Great Allegheny Passage, reimagining the train sculpture as one built on the region’s industrial past with hopes for a greener future.

Permanence also plays a role in these works. Laura DeFazio, a professor of art and design at California University of Pennsylvania, created Ohiopyle’s Trail Town piece. DeFazio’s work is decidedly permanent in nature: The pieces represent a thumbnail sketch of the biodiversity in Ohiopyle State Park, a naturalist haven. Divided into elemental categories: a dragonfly on the stone designated for Air creatures, rabbits for Earth, and a turtle for Water. Carved into the side of rough-hewn native sandstone, the pieces are akin to the petroglyphs DeFazio saw along the Cuyahoga while living in Ohio. And like those pieces, DeFazio says, these could stand for a long time.

“There’s such a fantastic timeless quality about Ohiopyle,” she says, “it inspired that sense of wanting to leave something permanent for the future—these could still be here hundreds of years from now.”

It’s a good example of the Trail Town goal—and, perhaps, that of all of these projects: to create public art that becomes intrinsically part of its location and remains an emblem of the community, even after the celebration of Pittsburgh 250 has long passed.
