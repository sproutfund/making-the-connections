# Pittsburgh at 250: A Preface

The story of Pittsburgh’s founding has all the elements one could ask of a great American legend. A martyr, in the defeat and death of General Edward Braddock as he marched on the French at the forks of the Ohio River. General John Forbes is its redeemer, his men laboriously cutting a trail through the wilderness from Philadelphia to attack Fort Duquesne—this time, successfully. George Washington completes the pantheon, standing with Forbes in November of 1758, at the place where three rivers meet to claim the surrounding land in the name of British statesman William Pitt.

When it came time, 250 years later, to mark that anniversary, it was obvious to the Pittsburgh 250 Commission and the Allegheny Conference on Community Development—the organization entrusted with coordinating events and activities related to the anniversary—that the date required a celebration that mirrored the iconic history of the Pittsburgh region.

At the Point—the historic site of Fort Duquesne—a $35 million renovation upgraded the State Park at Pittsburgh’s heart. The Tour of Pennsylvania bicycle race attracted elite young cyclists from around the world to ride in a Philadelphia-to-Pittsburgh competition retracing the Forbes Trail, and nearly 100 other cyclists joined in the 335-mile ride celebrating the opening of the Great Allegheny Passage Washington, D.C.-to-Pittsburgh trail. Many homecomings and reunions brought 50,000 visitors back to Pittsburgh throughout 2008, many of whom were able to see world-class art exhibits and performances thanks to the Pittsburgh International Festival of Firsts and the Carnegie International.

Pittsburgh 250 also recognized some of Pittsburgh’s most notable native sons and daughters, who were fêted at the History Makers Gala. Among the honored guests recognized for their impact on the region were historian and biographer David McCullough, actress Shirley Jones, philanthropist Teresa Heinz, and football great Franco Harris.

To the outside world, Pittsburgh may be most well known for the moments when its legends made history, be that Andrew Carnegie’s revolution in steelmaking, the many National Football Championships of the Pittsburgh Steelers, or Jonas Salk stepping out of his University of Pittsburgh lab with the world’s polio vaccine.

However, Pittsburgh’s story is not only “the biography of great men,” nor is it a mere timeline of pivotal events confined to the city’s limits. It is a chronicle of incremental shifts and exceptional but unassuming individuals; one that takes place as much in a schoolroom or a neighborhood club as in a boardroom or science lab. It’s the stories that occurred in Bedford and Butler counties where Forbes and Washington camped, and in the pioneer towns of Greene County where settlers launched a new nation’s Westward expansion.

Pittsburgh’s biography is Gus Greenlee in his Crawford Grill in the Hill District, grooming a generation of jazz players who would create “America’s classical music.” It’s Wilma Scott Heide growing up in Connellsville, imagining a world where women are treated as equals. And it’s the communities of Cambria County and the Mon Valley, producing the coal and the steel that built the American century.

In the same way, the 250th anniversary had to include momentous events and stories of legendary figures, just like the region had produced momentous history and legendary personalities. But it also had to include recognition of those individuals who keep the region’s wheels constantly in motion, even when no mark appears on the timeline.

When we look back at the founding of Pittsburgh in the fall of 1758, we don’t see a single day on which this place came to be—nor is our vision for this region’s next 250 years so firmly cast. Rather, ours is an evolving story of people and events, both grand and small, covering hundreds of miles and including millions of voices.
