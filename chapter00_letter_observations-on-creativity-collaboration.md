# A Letter from the Community Connections Committee Co-Chairs: Observations on Creativity, Collaboration

In late 2005, the Allegheny Conference on Community Development called us together to discuss a budding concept. We were asked to develop the community component of Pittsburgh 250. A mission with few parameters, but three ambitious goals: grassroots inclusivity, regional collaboration, and new models of community engagement.

Over the course of the next three years, with the help of hundreds of people from around the region, our initial ideas solidified into an initiative that has involved thousands more, created a new model for community-based philanthropic work, and built new networks that will continue to help the region grow for years to come. Through this work, we‘ve seen communities both small and large draw closer together, and a renewed sense of understanding between the city and the countryside. We’ve seen how the potential for progress only increases as our discussions become more collaborative, our missions more inclusive, and our vision more expansive. Most importantly, we’ve seen a common recognition, among people involved at all levels of this process, that community connections are important, powerful, and precious things.

Many people from around Southwestern Pennsylvania deserve credit for further developing the program, and enabling Community Connections to exceed our initial goals. The more than 40 regional leaders who came together as the Community Connections Committee were integral in streamlining and acting upon the initiative’s plans. Community Connections wouldn’t have made it past the idea stage without the leadership and stewardship of the region’s generous foundation community. Likewise, without the financial support and relationship-building power of the area’s community foundations and corporate funders, Community Connections couldn’t have encompassed the range it did. Moreover, The Sprout Fund’s continued work in all corners of the region is at the heart of everything that Community Connections has accomplished.

But such credit is largely academic compared to that deserved by the hundreds of community leaders, project managers, decisionmakers, and participants across the 14-county region. Their creativity, time, and bottomless wells of energy are the source of the 100 projects that will become the lasting legacy of Community Connections. It has been our absolute privilege to be a part of your work, and to watch Pittsburgh 250 connect county to county, neighbor to neighbor, and the past to the present in building our region’s future.
