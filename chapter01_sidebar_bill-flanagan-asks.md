# SIDEBAR: Bill Flanagan asks: How do you make a city’s anniversary something an entire region can celebrate?

It’s a question that three partners set out to answer in 2004, when they came together at the request of Allegheny County Executive Dan Onorato and then City of Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy. The Allegheny Conference on Community Development, the Heinz History Center and VisitPittsburgh developed a strategic blueprint for Pittsburgh 250 and organized the Pittsburgh 250th Anniversary Commission.

We knew there would be permanent improvements and major community events. We commemorated the Forbes Trail across Pennsylvania and supported the completion of the Great Allegheny Passage—a 300-mile biking and hiking trail from Washington, D.C. to Pittsburgh—as well as the transformation of Point State Park. We showcased the projects with events covering 300 miles, an international bike race from Philadelphia, a community trail ride from Washington, D.C., and a two-month Festival of Lights. We promoted numerous arts and cultural premieres, from the Carnegie Museums and the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust to the Frick Art &amp; Historical Center and the Heinz History Center. Hundreds of thousands of people turned out and millions more learned about it in media coverage worldwide.

But the almost 200 members of the Commission were determined not to limit the celebrations to the City of Pittsburgh’s anniversary. They wanted to make Pittsburgh 250 as regional as possible in scope. The reason was simple: In today’s global economy, winning the competition for tourists, talented workers, and investment depends upon everything an entire region has to offer.

It helped that two other major 250th anniversary celebrations were already being planned in Bedford and in Ligonier, Westmoreland County. Both were named during the Forbes Campaign of 1758 that also led to the naming of Pittsburgh. Partnering with them was straightforward. The challenge was to find a way to include communities in 11 other counties in South-
western Pennsylvania. And that was the genesis of Community Connections.

We borrowed the name of the initiative from Jamestown 400 and turned it over to the Community Connections Committee and later to The Sprout Fund with a promise to help raise one million dollars. Why a million? Because even today, people tend to pay attention if you say you’re going to give away “a million bucks.”

Oh, and we had one other requirement: The process to select the community projects funded by the initiative had to be as grassroots as possible. We didn’t want there to be any perception that “Pittsburgh” was playing favorites or picking winners.

So, here we are, five years later, summing up a truly remarkable record of grassroots decisionmaking and community outreach. I think it’s safe to say that Community Connections and The Sprout Fund far exceeded our expectations by inventing a whole new way to connect and galvanize communities across our region.

We hope as a result of Community Connections that people throughout the 14 counties have a better sense of the heritage we all share and a renewed pride in where we are today. Most of all, we hope that they will be ready and willing to work together again to make “Greater Pittsburgh” even greater in the future.
